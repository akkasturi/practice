1. How to solve tree problems or General steps/pattern in tree problems.
  - Identify what traversal would be needed (pre/in/post). For example:
      -- Post order traversal is needed if parent has to take the decision based on 
         the results from both children nodes. e.g. LCA in Binary Tree.
      -- In order traversal is needed if  
      -- Pre order traversal is needed if 
  
  - Identify if results from previous iteration has to be passed to next or vice versa, 
      -- if yes then how to pass it.
      -- How to process the result. << this is core Logic of the algorithm.
  - What would be terminating conditions.

In general, where we have dependancy tasks, i.e. before starting the task X , another set of task(s) should be finished.

  1. Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph
        Given a Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and a source vertex s in it, find the longest distances from s to all other vertices in the given graph.
  2. Shortest Path in Directed Acyclic Graph
        Given a Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from given source to all other vertices.
  3. Number of paths from source to destination in a directed acyclic graph
        Given a Directed Acyclic Graph with n vertices and m edges. The task is to find the number of different paths that exist from a source vertex to destination vertex. 
  4. Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph
  5. Clone Graph 
  6. Possibility of finishing all courses given pre-requisites

      There are a total of N courses you have to take, labeled from 1 to N. Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 2 you have to first take course 1,  
      which is expressed as a pair: [1,2]. 

      Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses. return 1/0 if it is possible/not possible.
      The list of prerequisite pair are given in two integer arrays B and C where B[i] is a prerequisite for C[i].

      Example:

      If N = 3 and the prerequisite pairs are [1,2] and [2,3], then you can finish courses in the following order: 1, 2 and 3.
      But if N = 2 and the prerequisite pairs are [1,2] and [2,1], then it is not possible for you to finish all the courses. 

  7. Commutable Islands
      There are n islands and there are many bridges connecting them. Each bridge has some cost attached to it.
      We need to find bridges with minimal cost such that all islands are connected.

  8. All topological sorts of a graph.
  9. Check if a given directed graph is strongly connected | Set 2 (Kosaraju using BFS)
      Given a directed graph, find out whether the graph is strongly connected or not. A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between any two 
      pairs of vertices. 

  10. Minimum spanning tree.
  11. Bipartite Graph
  12. Graph coloring
         Color the nodes in a graph so adjacent nodes always have different colors.
  13. Find Maximum cost path in Weighted Directed Graph from given Source to Destination.
